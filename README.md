## Hey there ðŸ‘‹ 
Welcome to my **nearly** abandoned GitHub page, and since Discord suddenly decided to implement GitHub page linking, I'll be making a personal page here.

I'm **Cut Of Meat**, or **Joseph** if you'd like to address me personally. I'm from the east part of the United States and plan on advancing in my coding professions in the coming years. 

I don't tend to be on GitHub as much, so if you want to keep in touch with me, you can check my progression on some Medium articles I make and message me on Discord for a quick conversation. 

**Discord:** Cut Of Meat#0001   
**Medium:** @cutofmeat

## Interests ðŸ”§

I hope to increase my knowledge in **basic coding**, primarily focusing on programming languages like **Python**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **C#**.
